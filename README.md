# IOT Project : Dimitrios Primpas, Arthur Picouleau

Our project is based on motion recognition and in particular on taking into account a double tap between the user's thumb and index finger. To do this, we are using the accelerometer contained in the LSM6DS3 IMU, itself contained in the Seeed Xiao BLE nRF52840 Sense board.

To carry out this project, we decided to use the ArduinoIDE platform.
We coded 3 programs using the double tap functionality.
